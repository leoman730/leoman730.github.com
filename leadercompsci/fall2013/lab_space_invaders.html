<h2>
  Project: Space Invaders
</h2>

<p>In this project you will be recreating a game similar to the game space invaders.</p>

<h3> Monday: Getting started</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <strong>Open the project template:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx12ANAPqJ7ZWG5sVXViM0V2TVU/edit?usp=sharing'>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx12ANAPqJ7ZWG5sVXViM0V2TVU/edit?usp=sharing</a> and download the template file.</li>
      <li>Open the template file in BYOB.</li>
      <li>Name the file 'space-invaders-YOUR-NAME' and save it in the folder on the desktop that says 'Save files here.'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
  <strong>Add code to the player sprite so that:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When the green flag is clicked, the player goes to the x position of 0 and y position of -175.</li>
      <li>When the right arrow is clicked, the player's x position changes by 10.</li>
      <li>When the left arrow is clicked, the player's x position changes by -10.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
  <strong>Add code to the bullet so that:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>When the green flag is clicked, the bullet is hidden</li>
      <li>When the space key is pressed.... 1) the bullet becomes visible and matches the position of the player</li>
      <li>When the space key is pressed.... 2) the bullet starts moving up until it touches the top sprite</li>
      <li>When the space key is pressed.... 3) becomes hidden after it touches the top sprite</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3> Tuesday: Adding invaders</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <strong>Import the invader project template:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Open your project file (space-invaders-YOUR-NAME.ypr) in BYOB.</li>
      <li>Import the invader template file into your project by downloading <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5eA9XYPP3mQejlkTUhOc2U1Q1k/edit?usp=sharing'>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5eA9XYPP3mQejlkTUhOc2U1Q1k/edit?usp=sharing</a>, then importing it into your project by choosing "File" => "Import Project...".</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>

  <strong>Following the instructions in the template, add code to the invader so that:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>It starts at the top left corner of the stage and then moves back and forth across and down the stage..</li>
      <li>It disappears if hit with a bullet.</li>
      <li>It ends the game if it reaches the ground.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <strong>Now, clone the one invader sprite to make 10 different invaders that move in unison!</strong>

  <li>Once you've completed your lab, save your BYOB file as 'space-invaders-YOUR-NAME' and email it as an attachment to help@leaderscompsci.com</li>

</ol>

<h3>Wednesday: Catching up and Organizing</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <strong>Import the enemy sprite template from yesterday, and complete the directions if you haven't done so already.</strong>
  </li>

  <li>Organize your code by building your own blocks. Find code that you use more than once, and stash it in a command, better yet, a reporter or predicate. Your project must use at least one custom block.</li>
  
  <li>Once you've completed your lab, save your BYOB file as 'space-invaders-YOUR-NAME' and email it as an attachment to help@leaderscompsci.com</li>

</ol>

<h3>Thursday: Bug Fixes and Submitting!</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <strong>Today is the last day of the lab, so make sure you meet all the requirements from previous days and fix bugs in your code.</strong>
  </li>

  <li>Once you've completed your lab, save your BYOB file as 'space-invaders-YOUR-NAME' and email it as an attachment to help@leaderscompsci.com</li>
</ol>
