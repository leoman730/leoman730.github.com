<h2>
  Lab: Using Lists
</h2>

<p>In this lab, you will use your new knowledge of lists to build two functions: <strong>maximum of</strong> and <strong>average of</strong>.</p>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open up BYOB to create a new file.</li>

  <li>
    <p>Create a block that will find the maximum number in a list, called <strong>maximum of</strong>. Make sure it's a <strong>reporter</strong>, in the <strong>operator</strong> category, and that it <strong>accepts one argument</strong>.</p>
    <p>Write the code inside of the block definition; it should be almost identical to the "mimimum" function that was constructed in class today. Just as a reminder, you will need to create <strong>two variables</strong> and your code will involve the <strong>repeat</strong> block.</p>
    <p>When you've written the block, make sure to test it in a variety of inputs. Can you think of special inputs that would be useful to test <strong>for experience points!</strong></p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Create a block that will find the longest word in a list, called <strong>longest word in </strong>. Make sure it's a <strong>reporter</strong>, in the <strong>operator</strong> category, and that it <strong>accepts one argument</strong> (list of words).</p>
    <p>Your code will be very similar to the maximum reporter that you created above, except you will use the 'length of' <strong>string</strong> operator in your comparisons.</p>

  </li>
  
  <li>
    <p>Create a block that will find the average of the numbers in a list, called <strong>average of</strong>. Make sure it's a <strong>reporter</strong>, in the <strong>operator</strong> category, and that it <strong>accepts one argument</strong>.</p>
    <p>Write the code inside of the block definition; it should be <strong>very similar</strong> to the minimum and maximum functions, but with code to sum up numbers instead of checking and setting values. Just as a reminder, you will need to create <strong>two variables</strong> and your code will involve the <strong>repeat</strong> block.</p>
    <p>When you've written the block, make sure to test it in a variety of inputs. Can you think of special inputs that would be useful to test <strong>for experience points!</strong></p>
  </li>

  <li>Once you've completed your lab, save your BYOB file and email it as an attachment to <a href="mailto:help@leaderscompsci.com">help@leaderscompsci.com</a>.</li>
