  <br/>
  <li>Click on the link and complete the survey: <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/1314TEALSsurvey">https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/1314TEALSsurvey</a></li>
  <br/>
  <li>After you have submitted the survey, go <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx12ANAPqJ7ZYjViN19oa0ZkMVE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and download the BYOB template for this lab.</li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    Open the lab-3 template from your downloads folder. This is a prebuilt program that you are to modify. Take a moment to notice that there are 3 sprites on the stage. Each one of them responds to key presses, which are listed on the stage. 
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    Perform each modification to the program:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <ol>
      <li>Walk Sprite: Make the sprite move diagonally accross the screen</li>
      <li>Walk Sprite: Import new costumes of your choice to replace the current costumes</li>
      <li>Walk Sprite: Replace the 'change x', 'change y' blocks with the glide to block</li>
      <br/>
      <li>Draw Sprite: Add 'change color effect by _' block</li>
      <li>Draw Sprite: Change side_length and angle variable at the bottom of the screen</li>
      <li>Draw Sprite: Instead of adding 5 to the variables in the 'move _ steps' 'turn _ degrees', try adding a different number</li>
      <br/>
      <li>Squirrel Sprite: Identify the if block in the code</li>
      <li>Squirrel Sprite: What do you have to do to get that code to run?</li>
      <li>Squirrel Sprite: Within the if block, instead of changing the color effect, select a different effect from the dropdown to edit</li>
      <li>Squirrel Sprite: Play a sound within the if block</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <br/>
  <li>
    After that, see what interesting modifications you can come up with. Today is all about experimentation, so try things out and see what happens! If you don't know what something does, play around with it to see if you can figure it out.
