<h2>
  Mario Rainstorm! Lab
</h2>

<p>Go <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5eA9XYPP3mQTGVvYmdmR3BLVlk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and download the BYOB template for this lab. The instructions are on the lab. Have fun! Submit to leaders.hs.cs.2013@gmail.com at the end of class.</p>

<p>Perform each of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right now, only the "Bad Guy" sprite will fall, and he always falls in the same spot. Edit the scripts for the Bad Guy Sprite so that he falls from a random spot each time.</li>
 
  <li>Make the Bananas fall from a different random spot each time, just like the Bad Guy. If the Bananas fall on Mario, he gets a point.</li>

  <li>Create a new falling enemy "Slowdown" sprite. It should fall randomly just like the Bad Guy and Banana sprites. If it falls on Mario, it slows down Mario's speed by 10.</li>

  <li>Create a new falling reward "Speedup" sprite. It works just like the Slowdown sprite from the previous step, except that if it falls on Mario, Mario speeds up by 10.</li>

  <li><p>You're done! Continue playing around, and consider adding new sprites that have the following effects on Mario:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enemy sprite that "freezes" Mario for 5 seconds. HINT: Set Mario's speed to 0, wait 5 seconds, then set his speed back to normal.</li>
      <li>Reward sprite that slows down (or freezes) all enemy sprites.</li>
      <li>???</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
