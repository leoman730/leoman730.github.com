<h2>
  Lab: Shape Drawing
</h2>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>

  <li>The lab has already been started for you <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/13238733/" target="_blank">here</a>. Open the link to the Scratch project and log in to your account by clicking the <em>'Sign In'</em> link at the top of the page.</li>

  <li>Once you are signed in, click the <em>'See Inside'</em> button at the top right of the page to view the project code. Then click the <em>'Remix'</em> button to start making your game from this project.</li>

  <li>Using the 'Repeat' block, draw a shape that has <code>polygonSides</code> sides, each of <code>polygonSideLength</code> length. Hover over <abbr title="To draw a regular polygon, you should turn 360/polygonSides degrees at each corner of the polygon.">this link</abbr> for a hint about how to draw an regular polygon in Scratch.</li>

  <li>Now, using the 'Repeat Until' block, construct a script that when clicked, will draw your shape across the screen, spaced at even intervals of <code>polygonSpacing</code> distance apart. The shapes should cross the stage both horizontally and vertically. For example, with polygonSides = 3, polygonSideLength = 30, and polygonSpacing = 75, your stage should end up looking something like this:</li>
