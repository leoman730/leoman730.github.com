<h2>
  Lab: Shape Drawing II
</h2>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Please fill out <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/CSNYC_TEALS">this survey first</a> before anything else. It should take 10-20 minutes.</strong></li> 

  <li>Continue working on the lab from Tuesday. Here are the instructions again:</li>

  <li>Using the 'Repeat' block, draw a shape that has <code>polygonSides</code> sides, each of <code>polygonSideLength</code> length. Hover over <abbr title="To draw a regular polygon, you should turn 360/polygonSides degrees at each corner of the polygon.">this link</abbr> for a hint about how to draw an regular polygon in Scratch.</li>

  <li>Now, using the 'Repeat Until' block, construct a script that when clicked, will draw your shape across the screen, spaced at even intervals of <code>polygonSpacing</code> distance apart. The shapes should cross the stage both horizontally and vertically. For example, with polygonSides = 3, polygonSideLength = 30, and polygonSpacing = 75, your stage should end up looking something like this:</li>
