<h2>
  Lab: Function Parameters and Arguments
</h2>

<p>In this lab, you will use functions to build an intelligent spaceship cannon in Scratch. Topics in this lab: functions, parameters, arguments.</p>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>

  <li>The lab has already been started for you <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/13513039/" target="_blank">here</a>. Open the link to the Scratch project and log in to your account by clicking the <em>'Sign In'</em> link at the top of the page.</li>

  <li>Once you are signed in, click the <em>'See Inside'</em> button at the top right of the page to view the project code. Then click the <em>'Remix'</em> button to start making your game from this project.</li>

  <li>Examine the contents of the computeAngleToEnemy block. What is this block doing?</li>

  <li>Now, create a function inside the pointAtAngle block for the spaceship sprite. It should use the argument passed in for "angle" to determine in which angle to point the spaceship.</li>

  <li>Next, create a function inside the fireAtAngle block that shoots the missile at the angle passed in as the "angle" argument.</li>

  <li>Finally, test out your code! If you've implemented the pointAtAngle and fireAtAngle blocks correctly, you should be able to move the enemy anywhere on the stage, and when you press spacebar, it should always fire in the direction of the enemy.</li>

  <li>(BONUS!) If you've already made it this far, write a new function fireAtAngleAndDistance that has two parameters: "angle" and "distance." With this function, the missile should only be shot the specified distance.</li>

  <li>Be sure to share your project by clicking the <em>'Share'</em> button at the top right of the page so the project can be graded!</li>

  <li>Save time at the end of class to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1az7Ec1-JKS4DnuKEygIJsDgbaGsArEhZmTJkWYwhfig/viewform" target="_blank">fill out his form</a> and submit your lab.</li>

</ol>
