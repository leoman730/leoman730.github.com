<h3>
  Welcome to the brand new Intro to Computer Science course at Leaders High School!
</h3>

<h3>This is a different class than what you are used to...</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    You will be working on a computer for most of the class.
  </li>

  <li>
    This course is led by professional computer programmers who visit the school for this class only.
  </li>

  <li>
    There are no tests. This is a project based class where you will create your own video games and websites
  </li>

  <li>
    Homework is optional. If you use your time wisely, you will be able to complete your assignments in class. You will be able to work on projects on a home computer if you did not finish or if you want to add more to your project. (Please contact us if you have trouble accessing a computer at home.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Course Outline</h3>
<p>
  <li>
    Unit 1: Programming fundamentals - how a computer program works, how to make your own computer games, basic programming concepts (loops, operators, conditionals, variables) using <a href='http://scratch.mit.edu/'>Scratch</a>
  </li>

  <li>
    Unit 2: Web fundementals - how to make your own websites, HTML, CSS
  </li>

  <li>
    Unit 3: Advanced programming - learning how to do more advanced things with javascript, a written programming language using <a href='https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/programming'>Khan Academy's programming course</a>
  </li>
</p>

<h3>
  This course will also emphasize the following areas:
</h3>

<ul>

  <li>
    <h4>Problem Solving</h4>
    <p>
    Understanding the basic concepts and how to represent those in code is not enough if you donâ€™t know how to break a problem down into those basic parts. There will be numerous ways to break down a problem, and some are better than others. We will teach you how to evaluate multiple approaches to the same problem. As you begin to construct more complex programs, you will also begin to recognize the need for pre-planning and incremental testing. We will try to start you off with good practices for you to use as you move on to bigger and better projects.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Creativity</h4>
    <p>
    Coding is the perfect way to let your creativity loose. You will be working in digital environment where ideas can be tested quickly, mistakes can be undone, limitless possibilities for what you can make. This course will present plenty of opportunities to include art, game design, story telling, and music to your projects. We invite you to mix in any other outside interests that you can.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
    <p>
    Labs and projects will be individual assignments, but collaboration with your classmates will be a valuable resource for problem solving when you get stuck or need to brainstorm ideas. We encourage sharing and discussion during lab time but not to the point where it could interfere with developing of your own unique solutions to problems. This class will be fun to the extent that you incorporate your creativity into the programs you build. Copying someone else's work would not only be boring but obvious to graders.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Technology and Society</h4>
    <p>
    As a programmer and creator of technology, it is important for you to examine the consequences of technological development. Part of this class will focus on discussing current events and the societal and ethical implications of technology.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Experience Points
</h3>

<p>
  We want this course to give you enough flexibility to explore areas of computer science that interest you at a comfortable yet challenging pace. Since this is unique to each student, we want to offer additional incentives for taking personal initiative. Throughout the course we will be giving out Experience Points for exceptional things we notice in assignments or in the classroom. We will also post a list of things that you can do to earn additional points, e.g. learning how to count in binary, taking a codecademy course, or writing a computing and society critique of a current event. We will keep a running tally of Experience Points and will hold raffles for prizes where points can be used as tickets. At the end of the semester bigger prizes will be awarded to the students with the most cumulative points.
