<h2>
	Hello World!
</h2>

<p>Set up a Scratch account to start writing and sharing code online! Follow the steps below. You will turn in your lab by submitting the form in the last step.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a></li>

  <li>Click on the <em>"Join Scratch"</em> button at the top of the screen, and follow the steps. Choose a username and password that you will remember.</li>

  <li>Once you have created an account, click on <em>"Create"</em> in the top navigation bar to create a new program.</li>

  <li>Choose a sprite and backdrop for your program. You can draw a new sprite or choose one from the library.</li>

  <li>Using the "Say ___ for ___ seconds" block, make your sprite say "Hello world!".</li>

  <li>Next, using the "When this sprite clicked" and "Ask ___ and wait" blocks, make your sprite do the following whenever it's clicked: Ask the user for their name, and then say "Hello!".</li>

  <li>Use the rest of the lab time to explore the features of Scratch. One idea: Make your sprite say the user's name that they typed in.</li>

  <li>Share your program by hitting the share button. (You will need the URL to your shared remix for the lab submission form.)</li>

  <li>During the last 5 minutes of class, fill out this form to submit your lab: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZGVYF6idmx-FTEpXIh1Sue31O1ajAXmjpFZmc9K3q5E/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ZGVYF6idmx-FTEpXIh1Sue31O1ajAXmjpFZmc9K3q5E/viewform</a></li>
