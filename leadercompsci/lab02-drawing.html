<h2>
	Drawing!
</h2>

<p>Learn how to move your sprite around and draw things using blocks in the Motion and Pen categories! Follow the steps below. You will turn in your lab by submitting the form in the last step.</p>

<ol>

  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>

  <li>Create a new project and give it a name in the top left bar.</li>
  
  <li><b>Share your program by hitting the share button.</b> (You will need the URL to your shared remix for the lab submission form.)</li>

  <li>Choose a sprite and backdrop for your program.</li>
  
  <li>Using the "clear", "pen down", "set pen color", and "move" blocks, draw a black line.</li>
  
  <li>Using those same blocks, plus the "turn clockwise __ degrees" block, draw a square.</li>
  
  <li>Using those same blocks, draw an equilateral triangle. How many degrees do you have to turn to draw each edge?.</li>

  <li>Use the rest of the lab time to explore the features of Scratch, especially blocks in the Motion category. We will be using them again and again throughout the term.</li>

  <li>During the last 5 minutes of class, fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ImLMO4Hjn5cECRQguN8C5qo0qzG974mKnhmjYGz0Ekw/viewform">this form</a> to submit your lab.</li>
