<h2>
  Drawing, Continued
</h2>

<p>
  This week, we'll be working on a <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/347123">series of projects</a> related to drawing, motion, sound and sensing. By the end of the week, you'll be able to build programs that involve multiple sprites that change their appearance, make sounds and interact with each other.
</p>

<h3>Part I: Shape Drawing</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>

  <li>Open <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17728170">this starter project</a> and remix it. Follow the instructions in the project to draw a square, a red triangle, and the letter W.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Part II: Create Your Own Drawing</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/17728301">this starter project</a> and remix it. Using at least 7 different types of blocks from the <strong>Motion, Looks and Pen</strong> categories, create your own drawing. Use as many different blocks and sprites as you can!</li>
</ol>


<h3>Turning in Your Lab</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Make sure to share your projects by pressing the "Share" button.</strong></li>

  <li>Create a "Studio" for both of your projects by going to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/mystuff">"My Stuff"</a> and then clicking "+ New Studio." Click "Add Project" and add both of your projects from Parts I and II.</li>
