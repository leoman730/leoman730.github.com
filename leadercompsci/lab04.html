<h3>Part I: Maze</h3>
<p>
  When you press the '1' key, the pencil sprite should trace through the maze in the background without touching the black walls. Add in 'glide' motion blocks to complete the maze.
</p>

<h3>Part II: Star</h3>
<p>
  When you press the '2' key, the pencil sprite should connect the dots to draw the outline of the star from the background.
</p>

<h3>Part III: Initials</h3>
<p>
  When you press the '3' key, the pencil sprite should draw out your initials (or your whole name if you have time). Keep in mind when the pen needs to be up and when the pen needs to be down. If you finish, play with different pen sizes, shades, and colors. Be creative!
