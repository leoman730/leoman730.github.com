<h2>
  Loops
</h2>

<p>
  This week, we'll be working with loops. By the end of the week, you'll be able to build programs that use loops and sound blocks to create unique synthesized music.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>

  <li>Start a new project. Using Sound blocks and the loop blocks in the "Control" category, create a song.</li>

  <li>Add a sprite to your stage. Using the Looks blocks, make the sprite dance in sync with the music.</li>

  <li>At the end of class, fill out this form to submit your lab: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LBGiZjIpK5PDD65Kz--J70ortAKwmcRO8FS30sCFMB4/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LBGiZjIpK5PDD65Kz--J70ortAKwmcRO8FS30sCFMB4/viewform</a>.</li>
