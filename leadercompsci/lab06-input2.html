<h2>
  Input and Control, Part 2
</h2>

<p>
  This week, we'll be working with input and control. By the end of the week, you'll be able to control multiple sprites via the keyboard and simulate gravity.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>

  <li>Continue working on your project from yesterday -- you need to get gravity working the way it was explained yesterday.</li>

  <li>Add sprites to your page that represent platforms.</li>

  <li>Modify your code so that gravity will check if your sprite is touching the ground or any platform.</li>

  <li>At the end of class, fill out this form to submit your lab: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BukfRNGc-YWrFMvrR7zQgDGhXaFq-9ncS4yxF8Vij-Q/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BukfRNGc-YWrFMvrR7zQgDGhXaFq-9ncS4yxF8Vij-Q/viewform</a>.</li>
</ol>
