<h2>
  Broadcasting Messages
</h2>

<p>
  You've seen how to create gravity, and now you're going to experiment with broadcasting and receiving messages. They are an important mechanism for multiple sprites interacting.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>

  <li>Add two or more sprites on the screen.</li>

  <li>Set one of the sprites to broadcast a message when you press a key on the keyboard.</li>
  
  <li>Make the other sprite(s) respond to the message by saying something or doing even something more elaborate.</li>

  <li>At the end of class, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KHvKNnEK2lzzfEstdA3jV5b5191XlqxLCCRdBjKW53o/viewform">fill out this form to submit your lab</a>.</li>
