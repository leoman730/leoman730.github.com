<h2>
  Variables I: Shapes
</h2>

<p>
  You've seen how to create gravity, and now you're going to experiment with broadcasting and receiving messages. They are an important mechanism for multiple sprites interacting.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>

  <li>Part 1: Create a variable named <code>numberOfSides</code>. Write a script that draws a shape with the number of sides set in <code>numberOfSides</code>. Your script should clear all previous pen marks, then draw a new shape with the correct number of sides. <em>Hint: An exterior angle of a regular polygon has <code>360 / numberOfSides</code> degrees.</em></li>

<li>Experiment with your script to make sure it works by dragging the <code>numberOfSides</code> variable slider to new values and testing that it draws a shape with the correct number of sides.</li>

<li>Part 2: Once you've finished Part 1, add a script to ask the user "How many sides would you like to draw?" and then drawing a shape with that number of sides.</li>

  <li>At the end of class, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sOIgffKZ_8QOS3AjXUj4v1JgrqIq24L6doS8n3gQfTo/viewform">fill out this form to submit your lab</a>.</li>
