<h2>
  Random Variables
</h2>

<p>
With random variables, you can create games with unanticipated challenges. Let's build a game where Mario has to dodge enemies and collect rewards that are falling from the sky
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>

  <li>Remix <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/19783885">this project</a>. Don't forget to share it!</li>

  <li>There are 4 variables that you will use in the game: <code>marioSpeed</code>, <code>rewardSpeed</code>, <code>enemySpeed</code>, and <code>score</code>.</li>

  <li>Add scripts to make Mario move back and forth when you press the left and right arrow keys. Instead of moving a constant number of steps, though, make Mario move <code>marioSpeed</code> steps each time.</li>

  <li>Next, add a script to make the reward continously fall from the top of the screen. It should fall at <code>rewardSpeed</code>, and when it touches the ground, it should disappear, wait for 1 second, and then fall again from the top of the screen.</li>

  <li>Next, make the enemy fall just like the reward. It should fall at <code>enemySpeed</code>.</li>

  <li>Next: Mario should gain 1 point every time he collects (touches) a reward, and lose 1 point every time he hits an enemy.</li>

  <li>Finally, add some randomness into your game! Instead of falling from the same place at the top of the stage each time, the enemy and reward should fall from a different spot each time.</li>

  <li>At the end of class, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OZq3C0EgT0J4rZ_GphD4vc-BX9sh0pRRdnzZ8tCYiBo/viewform">fill out this form to submit your lab</a>.</li>
