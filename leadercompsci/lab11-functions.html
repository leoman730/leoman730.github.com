<h2>
  Using Functions
</h2>

<p>
  Functions are an important abstraction that save time in your programs, so let's practice building and using them!
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>

  <li>Implement the shape drawing function that we built together in class today.</li>

  <li>Create a new "max of (number1) and (number2)" function that returns the maximum of two numbers. You will need to create a variable (ie. "max number") to store the result.</li>
  
  <li>Create a new "average of (number1) and (number2)" function that returns the average of two numbers. You will need to create a variable (ie. "average value") to store the result.</li>
  
  <li>At the end of class, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1GmySV7CTj7fxzt12QC-enSj1euipktBUd6vh6gN3OEU/viewform">fill out this form to submit your lab</a>.</li>
</ol>
