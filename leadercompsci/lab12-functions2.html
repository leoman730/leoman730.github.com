<h2>
  Using Functions II
</h2>

<p>
Today, you'll be making several small functions in order to become proficient with their creation and use.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a> and log in to your account.</li>
  
  <li>Implement this function: <img src="images/moveleft.png"/> It should make your sprite point left and move a variable number of steps.</li>

  <li>Implement this function: <img src="images/isodd.png"/> It should set a variable to "true" when the number argument is odd and "false" when it is even (ie "is 3 odd?" = true).</li>
  
  <li>Implement this function: <img src="images/squared.png"/> It should set a variable to the square of the input value (ie. 2 squared is 4).</li>
  
  <li>Implement this function: <img src="images/countdown.png"/> This function is tricky. It should take a number as an argument, and the sprite should count down from the number to zero. You're not allowed to use any kind of repeat block.</li>


  <li>At the end of class, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Vy7HvI7Rkj2z7B7epuZYNKwTUb8YvRSxhYUbMANK_kQ/viewform">fill out this form to submit your lab</a>.</li>
</ol>
