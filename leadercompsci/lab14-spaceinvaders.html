<h2>
  Project: Space Invaders, Part I
</h2>

<p>In this lab, you will use your new knowledge of functions to make some basic features of a Space Invaders game.</p>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The project has already been started for you <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20978042/" target="_blank">here</a>. Open the link to the Scratch project and log in to your account by clicking the <em>'Sign In'</em> link at the top of the page.</li>

  <li>Once you are signed in, click the <em>'See Inside'</em> button at the top right of the page to view the project code. Then click the <em>'Remix'</em> button to start making your game from this project.</li>

  <li>There are several pieces missing from the project. Click on each of the three sprites (spaceship, invader and missile) and you'll see everything you need to fill in marked with "FILL IN." Following the directions in each comment note, add blocks to make the game work.</li>
</ol>
