<h2>
    Project: Space Invaders, the <strong>COMPLETE</strong> project
</h2>

<p>Over the next three days, we will combine our work from the previous two labs to create a complete space invaders game.</p>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Stage setup: The stage and sprites should be fitting for the space invaders game theme.</li>
    <li>Player motion: The player should move left and right corresponding to the left and right arrow keys.</li>
    <li>Missiles: Missiles should fire when the player presses the spacebar and the missiles should destroy invaders.</li>
    <li>Invader grid: There should be a grid of invaders spawned when the game first starts.</li>
    <li>Invader motion: The invaders should move in a zigzag motion as described in lab 14.</li>
    <li>Winning/losing conditions: The game should end and "You Win!" should be displayed if all invaders are killed. If an invader touches you, the game should say "You Lose!"</li>
    <li>Code quality: Your code should make use of functions and variables where appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Log in to scratch and use your work from lab 14 or 15 (the last two labs) as the starting point for this project.</li>
    <li>Combine the work from the last two labs; it should already implement most of the features described above.</li>
    <li>Make sure to <strong>share</strong> your project and submit a link to it at the end of each day we work on it <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16IWn7iBKmdy9Ztc5Z2Tlee4utQjroqbsxuRSuPQ0dBY/viewform?usp=send_form">here</a>.</li>
