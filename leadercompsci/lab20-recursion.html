<h2>
  Lab: Recursion
</h2>

<p>In this lab, you will use your new knowledge of recursion to write a function that computes the Nth Triangular Number.</p>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Fork the following project in Scratch: <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/22456109/">http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/22456109/</a>.</li>

  <li>The lab already has a "factorial" function filled in with what we went over in class. Using this function as a reference, create a NEW function named "triangular" which will compute the Nth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_number">triangular number</a>.</li>

</ol>
